PlayaHater code examples simply provide the following parameters:

1) Parent container that the player will be loaded into e.g. <em>this</em>
2) X position of the player within its parent container.
3) Y position of the player within its parent container.
4) Name of the media file to load, this is a String within an Array.  If the media is to be played progressively then use the full file path and extension e.g. <em>'http://example-nonstreaming.com/mymovie.flv'</em>, alternatively if the media is streamed for example via Flash Media Server then simply provide the file name e.g. <em>'mymovie'</em>.
5) URL parameter to be supplied if the media content is to be streamed e.g. path to server application: <em>'rtmp://example-streaming.com/app/'</em>.  If the content is to be played progressively then simply leave as an empty string.
6) Log function name e.g. <em>protected function logHandlerMethod(msg:String):void{};</em>.
7) Autoplay Boolean.
8) ObjectEncoding for the NetConnection (please read: http://goo.gl/RESQ4).

STREAMING:

new PlayaHater(this, 0, 0, [mymovie], 'rtmp://example-streaming.com/app/', logHandlerMethod, true, ObjectEncoding.AMF0);

PROGRESSIVE:

new PlayaHater(this, 0, 0, ['http://media.newtriks.com/flvs/lif.flv'], '', logHandlerMethod, true, ObjectEncoding.AMF0);
